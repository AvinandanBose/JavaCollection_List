<h1>Java Collection-List </h1>

<h3>The <i>List</i> interface extends Collection and declares the behavior of a collection that stores a sequence of elements. Elements can be inserted or accessed by
their position in the list, using a zero-based index. A list may contain duplicate elements. List is a generic interface that has this declaration:</h3>

<h3 align="Center">

```
public interface List<E> extends Collection<E>

```
</h3>

<h3>Here, E specifies the type of objects that the list will hold.</h3>

<h3>List in Java provides the facility to maintain the ordered collection. It contains the index-based methods to insert, update, delete and search the elements. It can have the duplicate elements also. We can also store the null elements in the list.</h3>
  
 <h3> The List interface is found in the <i>java.util</i> package and inherits the Collection interface.</h3>
